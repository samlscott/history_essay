\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The following paper aims to establish whether the 19th century Cape
Colony was corrupt or not, as well as the extent of this corruption

\hypertarget{historical-background}{%
\section{Historical Background}\label{historical-background}}

The Civil Service Act of 1885 as amended by Act 31 of 1888 gives an
indication that civil servants are not allowed to hold any office for
profit during active service Moving forward, it is important to
understand why this scenario is considered as corruption. I have
included a short background. However, there isn't much literature on
this topic, so the background is sparce. I start with a brief definition
of corruption, which is considered to be the abuse of a trusted position
with the purpose of illegally obtaining benefit. It is difficult to say
when corruption in SA started, due to minimal written records. However,
what literature has claimed, is that Jan van Riebeck (the founding
father of colonial SA), was accused of corruption. So, with a foundation
of corruption, it becomes important to question the pattern and extent
of corruption in SA The next question is to consider why it would be
considered as corruption if an individual is a private shareholder and a
civil servant simultaneously? According to the Civil Service Act of 1885
as amended by Act 31 of 1888, civil servants may not hold office for
profit during their time in active service. This is because civil
servants may Influence the regulation of private companies for their own
benefit, as they have something to gain.

\hypertarget{data}{%
\section{Data}\label{data}}

The data used in the investigation is a list of civil servants as well
as a list of limited liability companies. In order to fulfil this goal,
I make use of two datasets, namely a list of civil servants and a list
of shareholders of limited liability companies -- both from the 19th
century. The JscR dataset has around 7 000 observations, and the civil
servant list has around 40 000 observations.

\hypertarget{methodology}{%
\section{Methodology}\label{methodology}}

To establish whether there was corruption, matches between names in the
datasets needs to be established. 1. Concatenate name vectors in each of
the datasets -- create a full name variable 2. Remove spaces and dots
between 1st, 2nd, and last names -- ensure the highest number of matches
possible. Any difference in spaces or punctuation will negatively impact
the number of matches 3. Match names by doing an ``inner join'' R and
remove any duplicates 4. Aggregate number of shares held in each office
5. Use previous literature to establish LR impact

\hypertarget{results-and-discussion}{%
\section{Results and Discussion}\label{results-and-discussion}}

After matching the names, it is evident that there was corruption in the
18th century Cape Colony. The most problematic office was the Divisional
Courts and Offices. The industry invested most in was

\hypertarget{limitations}{%
\section{Limitations}\label{limitations}}

The way in which names are written in the data sets varies. The one
dataset contains more initials, whereas majority of the names in the
other dataset are written out in full.

More common names are more likely to produce matches.
